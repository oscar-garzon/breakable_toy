# To Do app

The To Do App allows you to add, edit and delete To Do. Tasks can be sorted by priority or/and due date. Task can also be filtered by name, 
priority and done/undone.  The app also shows metrics for the average time to finish a task.

This project is part of the work developed during the Encora's Apprenticeship.
